# 0: Load the data in RStudio
#Load the training and test data sets into RStudio, each in their own data frame.

# 1: Merge data sets
#Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.

# 2: Mean and standard deviation
#Create two new columns, containing the mean and standard deviation for each measurement respectively. Hint: Since some feature/column names are repeated, you may need to use the make.names() function in R.

# 3: Add new variables
#Create variables called ActivityLabel and ActivityName that label all observations with the corresponding activity labels and names respectively

#4: Create tidy data set
#From the data set in step 3, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 


#5: Submit on github
#Put all of your code for steps 1-4 above in a single R script file called run_analysis.R. In a single github repository, add the following:

#  The tidy data set which is the result of steps 1-4
#Your run_analysis.R script
#A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.
#A README.md file, that explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected. 
#Submit a link to your github repository containing all of these 4 deliverables.
